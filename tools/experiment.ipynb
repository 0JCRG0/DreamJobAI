This position is fully remote.What You’ll Do as a Senior Research ScientistDespite having been fundamentally altered by earlier industrial revolutions the construction industry has hardly budged with the computer revolution. In fact since 1970 labor productivity in the US construction industry has actually declined despite it more than doubling in the rest of the economy. This has contributed to housing shortages and the parlous state of infrastructure in some places and is sanding the gears of carbon reduction efforts.We think the industry is ripe for change and we’re pushing the leading edge of that change with our next generation T3 Platform the OS for Construction.

AST UTC 4 NST UTC 330About the JobOur core technology is Ruby on Rails and ReactJS on the web along with a hybrid React Native mobile app Youll be joining us in a period of rapid growth so your primary directive will be to roll up your sleeves and build stuff Our goal is for our product to be invisible to our users  it shouldnt get in the way of their work it shouldnt be confusing it shouldnt require training That requires us to be very considerate of our experience very collaborative in how we build our software and very close to our customers through the sales and support processYoull work closely with business design and customer support to craft the future of our product line and occasionally spin up wholly new products and codebases At a minimum youll need to be able to use your experience to work through ambiguity identify issues and offer suggestionsHere are a few concrete things that weve done lately and a few things on our short term roadmap to give you an idea of what kinds of things were up to and what you might doIntegrating our internal calendar system to sync with Google Calendar and othersUsing our APM software to monitor and identify a bottleneck in a specific API endpoint and resolve it through various possible techniquesAddressing a userreported bug in our React Native app where the keyboard when it was active was pushing some content outside of the accessible viewportUsing Twilios Conversations API to create a fully custom integrated chat experience in our app for people on a project to talk with one anotherAdding the ability to drag and drop to rearrange items in a todo listIdentifying an issue in an open source project we rely on fixing it and getting that fix approved and mergedAdding in robust CSS3 and JavaScript animations to provide users with more finegrained and delightful UI feedbackSpinning up a big net new feature behind a beta flag and slowly rolling it out to a test groupand so much moreOur team is small but growing and our roadmap is full of so much more than we could ever build right now In joining us youll have an outsized impact on the success of the product and company About YouWere looking for someone who is prolifically productive  which generally means youre quite comfortable with Rails andor React or something similar like Vue you know how to put things together and you can get things done Were looking for someone with experience creating and shipping software in a production environment and can show us or talk to us about it We dont do whiteboard interviews or algorithm lottery questions Instead we think the strongest indicator of whether you can do this type of work is whether you have successfully done this type of work before And for this role were going to ask you a lot about your past experience building productsOur company is fully remote and has been since before COVID Our only current limitations on remote work are that you reside in the continental United States and mostly work during US time zonesWere looking for someone who works and communicates well with others Building software is a collaborative process it requires a diverse team with different types of experts who all work together regularly and sometimes have to disagree and commit Teamwork like this is even more important in a distributed remote environment where effective collaboration is a bit more challengingWere looking for someone who has technical leadership experience or the strong desire to be in a technical leadership role To be considered youll needStaff Engineers at BuildBook play the role of technical leaders on our teams  we view them as mini CTOs The job is to know and grow a product or featureset as well as the small team of engineers that work on that project Technical leaders have the autonomy to make daytoday engineering decisions on their own but should also understand when to collaborate with other teams or reach out for help The job is to collaborate with their team to produce an amazing product and solve realworld problems for our customersStaff level technical leaders are still Individual Contributors and while they might be providing some amount of mentorship to their team they arent people managers and wont have direct reports They tend to lead through experience the results of which are seen in the amazing features and products their teams produce Theyre more of a maker than a managerSuccessful tech leads at BuildBook tend to be people who have a good bit of experience in building products from start to finish in a collaborative crossfunctional team environment Youre comfortable with a little ambiguity sometimes and can use your past experience to guide things from raw concepts to buildable products You understand that good engineering decisions are about finding the best path forward given the constraints youre working with Our requirements are somewhat flexible for this role as wed rather be as inclusive as possible As such the following are requirementsAt least 5 years of professional software development experience working in a team environment A successful Staff Engineer tends to have more experience than this thoughThe ideal candidate will have 1 years of experience                         [0.0698923, -0.61222374, -0.4019082, -0.17872101, 0.6088965, -0.27675462, 0.69662005,

hybrid React Native mobile app Youll be joining us in a period of rapid growth so your primary directive will be to roll up your sleeves and build stuff Our goal is for our product to be invisible to our users  it shouldnt get in the way of their work it shouldnt be confusing it shouldnt require training That requires us to be very considerate of our experience very collaborative in how we build our software and very close to our customers through the sales and support process Youll work closely with business design and customer support to craft the future of our product line and occasionally spin up wholly new products and codebases At a minimum youll need to be able to use your experience to work through ambiguity identify issues and offer suggestions Here are a few concrete things that weve done lately and a few things on our short term roadmap to give you an idea of what kinds of things were up to and what you might doIntegrating our internal calendar system to sync with Google Calendar and othersUsing our APM software to monitor and identify a bottleneck in a specific API endpoint and resolve it through various possible techniquesAddressing a userreported bug in our React Native app where the keyboard when it was active was pushing some content outside of the accessible viewportUsing Twilios Conversations API to create a fully custom integrated chat experience in our app for people on a project to talk with one anotherAdding the ability to drag and drop to rearrange items in a todo listIdentifying an issue in an open source project we rely on fixing it and getting that fix approved and mergedAdding in robust CSS3 and JavaScript animations to provide users with more finegrained and delightful UI feedbackSpinning up a big net new feature behind a beta flag and slowly rolling it out to a test groupand so much moreOur team is small but growing and our roadmap is full of so much more than we could ever build right now In joining us youll have an outsized impact on the success of the product and company About YouWere looking for someone who is prolifically productive  which generally means youre quite comfortable with Rails andor React or something similar like Vue you know how to put things together and you can get things done Were looking for someone with experience creating and shipping software in a production environment and can show us or talk to us about it We dont do whiteboard interviews or algorithm lottery questions Instead we think the strongest indicator of whether you can do this type of work is whether you have successfully done this type of work before And for this role were going to ask you a lot about your past experience building products and leading teamsOur company is fully remote and has been since before COVID Our only current limitations on remote work are that you reside in the continental United States and mostly work during US time zonesWere looking for someone who works and communicates well with others Building software is a collaborative process it requires a diverse team with different types of experts who all work together regularly and sometimes have to disagree and commit Teamwork like this is even more important in a distributed remote environment where effective collaboration is a bit more challengingWere looking for someone who has leadership experience or the strong desire to be in a leadership role and understands the responsibilities that come along with it Due to our strong selfmanagement culture this role will be more of a hybrid type of leadership role  some people management some technical leadership and occasionally some codingTo be considered youll needEngineering Managers at BuildBook play the role of people leaders on our teams  we view them as mini VPEs The job is to know and grow a product or featureset as well as the small team of engineers that work on that project Engineering Managers have the autonomy to make daytoday engineering decisions on their own but should also understand when to collaborate with other people or teams or reach out for help Engineering Managers at BuildBook are more of a manager than a maker Their goal is to make the team the best that it can be which can require mentorship effective communication facilitation work and more Engineering Managers tend to not do quite as much daytoday coding but can roll up their sleeves when necessarySuccessful Engineering Managers at BuildBook tend to be people who have a good bit of experience in building products from start to finish in a collaborative crossfunctional team environment You might not be an expert on any single thing or the most senior person on the team but youre the type of person who can ensure something is getting done even if you arent the person doing it Your job is to make sure the proverbial trains are running on time You understand that good engineering decisions are about finding the best path forward given the constraints youre working with Youll be managing a team of up to 5 other                        [0.021029564, -0.47130585, -0.45090804, -0.13614471, 0.6325816, -0.45748568, 0.6121594, 1.1371981, 0.18785885, -0.39844006,

The builders 🔨- people who are resourceful enjoy creating something from nothing and are energized by building the roller coaster while riding it. The self-starters 🙋- people who are intrinsically motivated proactive + autonomous and operate with an entrepreneurial mindset. The agile ⚡ - people who embrace change + ambiguity as constants and who experiment + adapt with speed and efficiency. The fighters 🥊 - people who are scrappy relentless in the face of a challenge and always operate with the underdog mentality. The partners 🤝 - people who leave their egos at the door are allergic to the “it’s not my job” mentality and put our customers and team ahead of themselves. The intellects 🧠 - people with insatiable curiosity who approach their work thoughtfully do their homework before asserting opinions and use data to make decisions. The truth-seekers 🔬 - people who don’t take things at face value and are willing to debate complex and nuanced truths but ultimately put pride aside and commit to the best decision for Maestro and our customers. The innovators 💡- people who think outside the box challenge the status quo and strive to solve problems creatively. The accountable🪞 - people who are self-aware and reflective and first look inward before making excuses or pointing fingers. The critical  🔍- people who don’t shy away from giving or accepting feedback even when it’s unfavorable and look at everything with a discerning eye because they know the battle is won in the details. The positive 🌈 - people who live life with a glass-half-full mentality and believe that imperfection and challenges exist to make them stronger. Sound like you?

We dramatically improve lives by letting healthcare professionals turn extra time and ambition into career growth and financial opportunity. We achieve this with our app-based marketplace that connects healthcare facilities and healthcare professionals allowing healthcare professionals to book on-demand shifts and healthcare facilities to access on-demand talent. Our mission is to enable healthcare professionals to work when and where they want and to enable healthcare facilities to meet their talent needs. About Clipboard Health: Clipboard Health is a post-Series C extremely fast-growing tech startup with classic two-sided network effects revolutionizing the market for healthcare talent. We are a diverse and inclusive company with a global remote team. We have been named one of YC’s Top Companies for two years running and have grown 25x across all key metrics in the last 18 months. There has never been a more exciting time to join our growing team and help us serve even more healthcare professionals and healthcare facilities who can then better serve patients. To learn more about the culture at Clipboard Health take a look at our culture hub here. About the Role:The Associate Product Manager – New Grad position is designed to grow undergraduates into product leaders. APMs at Clipboard Health move quickly with high ownership and good judgment from day 1. Previous APMs have scaled operational processes written new pricing algorithms from scratch and built new products all on their own. On their own = they were given a problem → they wrote an excellent plan that solved the problem → they executed that plan with full ownership. Our APMs are generalists who work closely with our executive team. Instead of coming in with a toolkit and looking for problems it can solve which often leads to incremental problem solving they focus on the biggest problems and quickly devise new ways to solve them from first principles. Doing this from day 1 requires that our APMs are boundlessly curious and jump right into understanding our business our users and our product. We think that their curiosity and the ability to dive deep ultimately equips them to be excellent contributors and effective leaders.Ownership is not given to APMs once we think they are able to lead projects. APMs are expected to lead important projects from the get-go. Their plans and the quality of their execution are met with the same level of scrutiny as that of a Group Product Manager’s. We think that doing the work and getting feedback on it is one of the fastest perhaps the fastest ways to learn and grow but it’s not the best path for everyone. We encourage you to think deeply about if that’s something you want.I’d read the following docs from our team prior to applying: the Product Team Standards Product Team Recruiting andProduct Team Structure. These documents will give you a sense of how we think and what we value. We also have more links about team and company culture on our candidate website.In your first 30 days you’ll: Talk to customers understand their problems and surface issues we weren’t devoting enough attention to Ramp up on the business the product and how we work Design and run marketplace experiments to validate hypotheses Write weekly write-ups and other documentation to keep others abreast of your work In your first 90 days you’ll: Own an important problem on your own Write a plan you may have to write several drafts that proposes a solution to the problem Broadcast the plan to relevant stakeholders get their feedback and adjust it Execute on the plan and report findings to the executive team You can’t be successful here if you: Don’t enjoy writing. We write a lot and we hold our writing to a high standard. If you aren’t comfortable being scrutinized on not only the content but the clarity of your writing week over week our culture won’t be a good fit for you. Want to know what to do. In your role as an APM you’ll regularly be given tasks that are seemingly ambiguous. You will have to use your judgment to bring clarity to it. You may even propose that the task isn’t something we should focus on today. That’s okay too. Don’t like working with data or math. As a marketplace company we have a highly quantitative culture. Our language is steeped in numbers. Don’t enjoy talking to customers. We talk to our customers day in and day out. Our customer conversations are an integral part of how we make decisions. Don’t want an intellectual challenge. The problems we face are novel and challenging and we expect people to solve them quickly. If you aren’t looking for an intellectual challenge in your role this won’t be a good fit.
