After talking with hundreds of independent engineers designers and product folks we heard over and over that finding vetted high-quality consistent clients is hard and projects are often too small to be rewarding. A·Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z YC Softbank General Catalyst etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020 and have helped A·Teamers earn $11.4+ million since. As part of A·Team you can expect:  High-paying meaningful missions with the most audacious companies sent your way; generally $110-$190/hr with vetted fascinating clients doing work that matters. Were picky about who we partner with; new clients only come in via trusted referral. Weve worked with Lyft McGraw Hill ClearCo irl.com the former CEO of Waze the leading vaccine production software several new unicorns we cant say here and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/etc. Work alongside friends old &amp; new: our niche is small/diverse product teams since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams not individuals. Of course we keep friends together whenever we can. Full autonomy: say no to things that dont excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once so theres never pressure to join an A·Team mission if you dont have the bandwidth. If were no longer a fit its easy to leave or pause too.  Small curated off-the-record gatherings: for conversations hard to have elsewhere. Long-term were creating micro-communities for the worlds top builders to become friends around the things they care about. Keep 100% of what you earn: if you charge $130/hr you get $130/hr. A·Team makes money by charging a small flat transparent platform fee on top of your rate.      How to apply: Go here: https://build.a.team/remotivereferral + mention Remotive. No resume or cover letter needed; we respect your time so the application is short. Were also much more interested in seeing what youve made and excited to chat more if there’s a fit. What you’ll do:   Once part of A.Team you’ll regularly be invited to impactful missions that match your interests which you can accept or decline. Take your pick from early-stage incubations with world-class founders to fast-growing super-funded companies to old school non-tech incumbents looking to build as a tech giant would   Missions usually involve building an ambitious piece of software from 0 to 1 as part of a small 3-4 person team.    You’ll be paid to scope it out give the client options guide strategy and execute on the selected solution. Sometimes the client has a clear vision sometimes not; which is why A.Team builders tend to be senior folks who can work together to find the right direction.    Who A·Team is for:   Senior software developers who left large companies and high-growth startups to pursue their craft with autonomy.   Those who prefer consistent contract work over a full-time role who want to create a variety of new products alongside other top-tier builders.   The majority of A.Teamers spend most of their time doing independent work but a sizeable percentage are either employed full-time (but testing out client work) bootstrapping a side project or looking for their next big thing   Who A·Team is not for:   People looking for small gigs   Folks looking to build simple wordpress/wix/squarespace-style websites   Those still early in their careers and recent university/bootcamp grads (at least not yet)   Our long-term vision: A·Team is a new type of company for a new kind of independent software builder. We call them unhirables: people who traditional companies couldn’t hire full-time even if they wanted to but who want to do their most meaningful work with their favorite people in small autonomous distributed expert teams.  To help us secure amazing missions we raised $5 million+ (not public yet) from NFX Village Global and Box Group along with the former CEO of Upwork the founders of Fiverr and Lemonade Apples Global Head of Recruiting YC Partner Aaron Harris Whartons Adam Grant and Dukes Dan Ariely.

We are seeking qualified, part-time internationally licensed psychotherapists to join our provider network and deliver care with a tech-enabled, AI/machine-learning platform that puts patient outcomes first. What You’ll Do: Provide counseling to clients with benefits ranging from short-term goal-focused EAP, to employer health plans allowing many sessions as medically necessary. Treat adults who have completed brief, evidence-based online screenings identifying their symptoms and areas of concern. Preferably, also be open to treating additional populations such as children, adolescents, couples, or families. Maintain a calendar displaying your availability and complete session documentation in a timely manner within our scheduling system. Use evidence-based treatment modalities and interventions that are tailored to your client’s needs. Collaborate with our dedicated provider support team, our licensed clinical care navigation team, and our administrative care support team whenever you need assistance.

You like working independently, but would also enjoy having the support of a team and opportunities for connections and collaboration with other providers and our master’s level clinical care navigators. You’ll set your own schedule to fit your professional and personal needs. Work from anywhere, as long as you have a confidential, private location with stable internet. No need to spend time marketing your practice, checking insurance eligibility, collecting fees, or submitting claims—we take care of the administrative work so that you can focus on clinical care. Grow your ability to provide effective care through feedback from evidence-based measures that help you identify what is working with your clients.

Se trata del aspecto de Conversión de Datos de un sistema, cuyo diseño es realizado por otros flujos de trabajo en el programa. Como resultado, las habilidades adicionales necesarias son las siguientes: ► Experiencia previa en implantación de sistemas informáticos ► Sólida experiencia en SAP ECC ► Experiencia reciente en conversiones de datos, preferiblemente en sistemas de Recursos Humanos; incluyendo la documentación de especificaciones de mapeo de datos de forma clara y precisa ► Sólidas habilidades de gestión de proyectos ► Capacidad demostrada para operar de forma independiente con una dirección y supervisión mínimas ► Debe ser proactivo en la identificación de formas de mejorar la calidad del proceso y la precisión de las conversiones de datos ► Capacidad para identificar formas de ayudar a la calidad de las conversiones de datos - incluso sin asignación directa de tareas ► Minuciosidad a la hora de mantener informado al responsable de la asignación sobre el estado de los entregables - sensibilizar con antelación sobre los elementos susceptibles de descarrilarse. Revisión de numerosos objetos de conversión, identificando qué elementos están abiertos con TI. Llevarlos hasta su cierre, al tiempo que se coordina con otras funciones fuera de TI. Lleve un registro de los elementos abiertos (requisitos de conversión no abordados) y asegúrese de que se abordan en los próximos ciclos de conversión. Ayudar a priorizarlos, así como el alcance con un ciclo de conversión. ► Revisar las pruebas y los defectos de cada ciclo de conversión, y coordinar su resolución (especialmente si los defectos se asignan a TI). ► Capacidad para colaborar con funciones ajenas a TI (ej: Talento, Consultoría) para impulsar resultados de calidad. ► Experiencia de trabajo con recursos deslocalizados ► Comunicar oportunamente el estado de los temas abiertos (específicamente los riesgos emergentes) ► Debido a la naturaleza del trabajo (conversiones de datos), la atención a los detalles es muy preferible y necesaria para que la persona tenga éxito en la asignación ► Gran capacidad de seguimiento y de cierre de los asuntos pendientes Tipo de puesto: Tiempo completo Salario: $25,000.00 - $35,000.00 al mes Horario:  Turno de 8 horas  Prestaciones:  Seguro de gastos médicos Trabajo desde casa  Experiencia:  Kanban: 2&nbsp;años (Obligatorio) sap ecc: 2&nbsp;años (Obligatorio)  Idioma:  Inglés (Obligatorio)  Lugar de trabajo: Remote                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Job Information:\\n- Job Title: Data Conversion Specialist\\n- Job Objective: The role involves working on the data conversion aspect of a system, with a focus on implementing computer systems and ensuring accurate and efficient data conversions.
