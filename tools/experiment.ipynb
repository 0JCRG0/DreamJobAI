Our main focus is embedding sustainability across the goals and mindset of businesses and helping everyone at all levels play their part. It’s true that one person turning off a light isn’t going to solve the problem but if large groups of people act spend and speak in a purposeful way… Big change is possible! That being said we recognise the scale of individual versus business’ carbon footprints so we are actively seeking out ways to help the latter align with science-based net zero too. Currently we deliver data back to business customers to help them make informed decisions about the direction of their operations. We have big plans to do even more in this space. In terms of what it’s like to work at Pawprint we’re a certified B Corp Living Wage Employer and 1% for the Planet member. We strive to walk the walk and act as a shining example for all stakeholders. A note on diversity: to beat climate change diversity of thought and experience is essential.

There needs to be a balance between the economy and the ecosystem hence we make all decisions based on their impact in the following areas:  Environmental - all efforts are made to undertake business in an environmentally friendly manner. For example we have a no flight policy for domestic travel and employees have the freedom to work flexibly where possible Philanthropic - we will actively support our nominated charities through financial donations each month and/or volunteering days Economic - we will strive to build a strong business financially with the aim to invest further in developments that allow us to extend our reach and drive further carbon reduction globally Ethical - we will always consider the ethics of our business partners and suppliers to ensure we support fair trade and fair working practices and any investments we make will be environmentally conscious  To ensure we achieve this as an organisation we will use these four areas as a checklist for all business decisions we undertake and will share them internally with all staff so they can be fully aware of our process and policy.
