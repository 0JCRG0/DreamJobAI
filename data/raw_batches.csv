We make it easy for people to find quality in-network mental health care by removing historic barriers faced by mental health providers payers and patients. 1 in 4 people in the US have a treatable mental health condition but the vast majority do not get the care they need. The primary reason is cost: the majority of therapists do not accept insurance meaning paying for therapy is prohibitively expensive for prospective patients. This is where we got our start – Headway has built the first software-enabled network of therapists who accept health insurance making it easy for therapists to grow their practices and possible for patients to find quality care they can afford. We launched in April of 2019 and are now powering 400 000+ appointments per month. To scale our vision we’ve raised over $100 million in funding from a16z Thrive Accel and Google Ventures.Join us and make an impact About engineering at HeadwayBuilding a new mental healthcare system at Headway is only possible because of the scale and leverage that software can provide. The engineering team at Headway is a small but mighty team using technology to build that future (and have a fun time while doing it!).Principles that guide us:Focus on the mission: We view software as a means of effecting change in the world not as an end unto itself. We write software to empower our patients and therapist to better solve the problems they’re facing. Ship small learn fast: We are building new and novel products and believe that we learn what our users need by quickly shipping and iterationEverything is a product: Whether its our patient search experience or a developer productivity improvement we treat everything we build at Headway as a product with end-users in mind.Optimize for trust: We believe that engineers should be continually learning.
